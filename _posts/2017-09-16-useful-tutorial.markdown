We've compiled a few resources from the internet for those of you who are having trouble with the coding or computer stuff.

- [Terminal tutorial for Mac or Linux](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)

- [Command prompt tutorial for Windows](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html) (only really need the "What is Command Prompt" and "Working with Files and Directories" section)

- [Python and NumPy tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) (can ignore the SciPy section for the most part)
