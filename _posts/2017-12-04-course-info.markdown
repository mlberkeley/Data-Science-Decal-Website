Have you ever wondered why everyone and their mothersâ€™ are talking about data science and machine learning? Does the fear of big data taking over the world keep you up at night? Do you want to learn about one of the hottest fields in modern industry? If so, welcome to the Machine Learning Decal! 

In this course, you will discover how to analyze and manipulate data in Python, go over (and implement!) fundamental and practical statistical and machine learning algorithms, as well as learn how to ask the right questions in order to tackle data-driven problems. The course content targets an audience who has experience programming and understands calculus, though motivated and interested students without a strong technical background are encouraged to participate.

No matter your background, data science and machine learning are infiltrating your field. More and more data is being created in more and more different places, and we hope to give you the skills to begin to make sense of it all.

## Prerequisites

This class is a projects-based class with a machine learning bias. You are expected to have some programming or statistics backgrounds and so the material will be of greatest benefit to sophomores or those who have taken CS61A, DATA 8, STAT 133, or equivalent. However, the first week of class will be a python bootcamp. By the end of it, you can determine whether you are comfortable continuing through the course. 

Note that this is not an easy class. The student facilitators intend to provide you with a comprehensive guide to data analysis with the goal of preparing you for industry and, if demonstrated superb interest, future machine learning competitions.
